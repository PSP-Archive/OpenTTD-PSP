This is a guide to compile strgen on gcc

All this is done in the makefile, so it's only interesting for people, who wants to alter something themselves (translators)

HOWTO compile lng files:

First you get strgen compiled (look below/download nightly build/run makefile)

strgen takes the argument of a txt file and translates it to a lng file and places that lng file in the same dir as the txt file.

Example 1:
if you are in the root of your working copy (svn code), you should type
strgen/strgen lang/english.txt
to compile englist.lng. It will be placed in the lang dir

Example 2:
you have strgen but not the source and you want to compile a txt file in the same dir. YOu should type
./strgen english.txt
and you will get english.lng in the same dir

You can change english to whatever language you want

Commands used by strgen

-v --version
strgen will tell what svn revision it is based on

-t
strgen will add <TODO> to the missing strings and use the english strings while compiling
this will need english.txt to be present

-w
strgen will print any missing strings to standard error output(stderr)
this will need english.txt to be present
